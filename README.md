# Village Bus Alerter
This project helps residents who live at the Gamecock Village be notified when the campus bus is in range of the 
apartment complex. The user has a choice of manually updating the bus times by hitting the \[**Check Bus Times**\].
In order to track the bus and be alerted when the bus is less than 5 minutes away just hit \[**Start Tracking Buses**\].
This will cause the system to continue track all buses going to the apartment complex until the user hits 
\[**Stop Tracking**\].
